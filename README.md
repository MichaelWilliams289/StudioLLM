Sure! Below is a markdown guide on how to run a Streamlit project, along with the code for a simple Streamlit application.

Guide to Running a Streamlit Project
Step 1: Install Streamlit
Before running a Streamlit project, you need to have Streamlit installed. You can install it via pip:
'''pip install streamlit'''

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit
Step 2: Create a Streamlit Application
Create a Python script for your Streamlit application. This script will contain your application code.

Step 3: Write Your Streamlit Application Code
Here's a simple example of a Streamlit application that displays a title and a text input:

python
Copy code
# app.py

import streamlit as st

def main():
    st.title("My Streamlit App")
    user_input = st.text_input("Enter your name:")
    st.write(f"Hello, {user_input}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Step 4: Run Your Streamlit Application
To run your Streamlit application, navigate to the directory containing your Python script (app.py in this example) in your terminal or command prompt, and then run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Step 5: View Your Streamlit Application
After running the above command, Streamlit will start a local server and provide you with a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can view your Streamlit application in your web browser.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully created and run a simple Streamlit application. You can now customize your Streamlit application further by adding more components, styling, and functionality as needed.

Feel free to explore the Streamlit documentation for more advanced features and examples.
